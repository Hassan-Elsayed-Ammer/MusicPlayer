This project is a demo android app that connects to the [HearThisAt API](https://hearthis.at/api-v2/) and shows a list of top artists with their tracks. When a track is selected the app streams it until another track is selected.  
Audio keeps on playing while browsing artists/songs. Playback stops by either quiting the app via back button or by swiping it out from the list of recent apps.

##### Technical details and used technologies
This project is written in Kotlin and uses Model-View-Presenter for better testability.

The app is built and unit tested with the help of Travis CI.
